# Backtesting Framework 🚀

## Introduction
Hey there! 👋 I'm Prabhat Pushp, and I'm excited to share the Backtesting Framework with you! This tool is designed to help you test your trading strategies using historical stock data. Whether you're a seasoned trader or just starting out, this framework empowers you to simulate your strategies and evaluate their performance based on real data. 

Understanding how your strategies would have performed in the past is crucial for making informed decisions in the future. This framework serves as a bridge between theoretical strategy development and practical application, ensuring that you can make data-driven decisions with confidence.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhat-pushp) for any questions or discussions about the project. Let's make trading smarter together! 💡

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Efficiently load and preprocess stock data from CSV files.
- **Strategy Implementation**: Supports various trading strategies, including moving average crossovers.
- **Randomization**: Randomly select stocks for testing to ensure robust strategy evaluation.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of the backtesting process for easy debugging and analysis.
- **Results Visualization**: Generate plots and save trade details for further analysis.

## Expected Data Formats 📊
The framework expects stock data in CSV format with the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the stock price (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- **Open**: The opening price of the stock.
- **High**: The highest price of the stock during the day.
- **Low**: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded.

Ensure that your CSV files are structured correctly for optimal performance.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **TA-Lib**: For technical analysis indicators.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing results.
- **Backtesting.py**: A library for backtesting trading strategies.
- **Loguru**: For enhanced logging capabilities.
